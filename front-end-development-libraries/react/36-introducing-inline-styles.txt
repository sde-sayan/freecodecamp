To style those JSX elements you create in React. You likely know that it won't be exactly the same as working with HTML
because of the way you apply classes to JSX elements.

If you import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different at all. You apply a class to your JSX element using the
className attribute, and apply styles to the class in
your stylesheet. Another option is to apply inline styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.

You apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example
of an inline style in HTML:

<div style="color: yellow; font-size: 16px">Mellow Yellow</div>

JSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a string.
Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:

<div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>

Notice how we camelCase the fontSize property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object.
React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.

class Colorful extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{color: "red", fontSize: 72}}>Big Red</div>
    );
  }
};
